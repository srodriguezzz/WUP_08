## make a simple regression model


```{r}
fullup <- lm(LENGTH~ .,data=BEARS)
summary.lm(fullup)
```



## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=BEARS)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=BEARS)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

This first model is a much clearer way to see the length of the bears' necks. The length continues to increase in a linear motion. 

## now predict the length of a bear who has a neck of 17, 22 and 26


```{r}
new <- data.frame(NECK=c(17,22,26))
predict(simp,new)
predict(simp,new,se.fit=TRUE)
```
## Surely there is another variable that can better predict LENGTH than NECK. Find one and compare its performance to that of neck by it value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better).
